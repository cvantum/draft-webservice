## Introduction

If you handle tournaments you usually open duel-based tournaments ( 1on1 ) or team-based tournaments ( n on n ). This web-service handles cases if you want to make an on-boarding system for single-players who want to participate in a team-based cup.

**This web-service is just running with toornament-api. There are no plans to extend those features to other tournament-systems (.e.g. Challonge )**
